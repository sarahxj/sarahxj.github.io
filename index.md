## About Me

I am an aspiring astronomer and exoplanet researcher. I graduated with my B.S. in Physics from Georgetown University in 2021, after which I spent a year as a research intern at the Space Telescope Science Institute. I currently work as a data analyst while continuing my research and outreach activities and plan to pursue a PhD in astronomy/astrophysics. My main research interests lie in exoplanet detection and characterization, particularly the search for habitable, Earth-like exoplanets, the history of star systems and exoplanet formation, the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres, and astrobiology.

When I'm not looking to the stars, I enjoy cooking and baking, reading, making art, trying out new restaurants, going to concerts, and cuddling with my cat, Missy.
