## About Me

I am an aspiring astronomer and exoplanet researcher. I graduated with my B.S. in Physics from Georgetown University in 2021, after which I spent a year as a research intern at the Space Telescope Science Institute. I currently work as a data analyst while continuing my research and outreach activities and plan to pursue a PhD in astronomy/astrophysics. My main research interests lie in exoplanet detection and characterization, particularly the search for habitable, Earth-like exoplanets, star and exoplanet formation, the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres, and astrobiology.

When I'm not looking to the stars, I enjoy cooking and baking, reading, making art, trying out new restaurants, going to concerts, and cuddling with my cat, Missy.

## Research

**Identifying Techniques to Separate Stellar Activity from Planetary Signals:** One of the main methods that researchers use to discover exoplanets is the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures and analyzes the Doppler shifts in stellar spectra caused by a planet "wobbling" its host star. This method has seen vast improvements in recent years, but as instruments near the precision levels needed to detect the small shifts caused by an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star, the detection of these planets is still limited by stellar activity masquerading as planetary signals in RV measurements.

In my work at the Space Telescope Science Institute, we sought to use machine learning to predict stellar activity signals from spectral features and distinguish between stellar activity and real planetary signals. We analyzed both solar and stellar spectra from the high-precision spectropgrahs HARPS-N and NEID for activity-correlated/sensitive features to identify informative inputs and calibrate our predictions for the models. During the course of this research, we determined that further research on the relationships between stellar activity and spectral features is necessary to avoid relying on "black box" models. To this end, we investigated a set of NEID spectra of Ïµ Eridani, a young, active K-dwarf star, to probe these relationships. We created an automated method to correlate line features in the spectra with stellar activity and identified lines sensitive to stellar activity in one or more of these line morphologies at the period of the star's rotation. These lines, which include four newly-identified lines sensitive to stellar activity, can be used as reference points for future work on mitigating stellar activity signals in RV measurements and understanding the physics of stellar activity-sensitive changes in spectral features.

## Outreach and Community Involvement

I enjoy sharing my passion for astronomy through teaching and outreach and I strive to be involved with community collaboration efforts as much as possible. I am particularly passionate about increasing the accessibility of astronomy to underserved communities and students and hope to increase opportunities for students from all backgrounds to become inspired by astronomy. I participate in a number of outreach activities, including but not limited to the following:

**Planet Finder Academy:** The Planet Finder Academy is an outreach program hosted by the California Institute of Technology for Pasadena-area high school students to learn about exoplanets and exoplanet science. Over the course of a one-week summer session in July and additional follow-up sessions during the school year, PFA students learn about the history of exoplanet science, the skills and methods that researchers use to study exoplanets today, and how to become involved with exoplanet research themselves. I am honored to be one of the lead instructors for the Planet Finder Academy. As part of the program's content, I developed Jupyter notebooks and worksheets for students to learn the basics of Python for scientific programming and the RV method for detecting exoplanets which can be found (HERE). I also assist with general day-to-day planning and instruction during the program.

**EPRV Research Coordination Network:** The [EPRV Research Coordination Network (RCN)](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/NNExplore/EPRV-RCN/EPRV-RCN-welcome/) is an intiative sponsored by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program to facilitate collaboration among RV researchers. As a member of the EPRV RCN, I participate in periodic meetings to help coordinate RV research efforts across the community and I have been fortunate to work with many other members of the EPRV RCN.

In the past, I have also served as the co-president of the [Georgetown University Astronomical Society](https://www.instagram.com/gtown_astro/), as an undergraduate board member of the [Georgetown University Women in Physics](https://physics.georgetown.edu/georgetown-university-women-in-physics-guwip/) (fun fact: I designed the logo!), and a member of the Student Advisory Council for the American Physical Society (APS)'s [Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/cuwip/index.cfm). I was also a member of the Georgetown University [Physicists Against Racism](https://par.georgetown.domains/) and the Georgetown University [Society of Physics Students](https://sps.georgetown.domains/). I was also an undergraduate teaching assistant for PHYS 101: Principles of Physics I and PHYS 102: Principles of Physics II.
