## About Me

I am an aspiring astronomer and exoplanet researcher. I graduated with my B.S. in Physics from Georgetown University in 2021, after which I spent a year as a research intern at the Space Telescope Science Institute. I currently work as a data analyst while continuing my research and outreach activities and plan to pursue a PhD in astronomy/astrophysics. My main research interests lie in exoplanet detection and characterization, particularly the search for habitable, Earth-like exoplanets, the history of star systems and exoplanet formation, the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres, and astrobiology.

When I'm not looking to the stars, I enjoy cooking and baking, reading, making art, trying out new restaurants, going to concerts, and cuddling with my cat, Missy.

## Research

**Identifying Techniques to Separate Stellar Activity from Planetary Signals:** One of the main methods that researchers use to discover exoplanets is the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures and analyzes the Doppler shifts in stellar spectra caused by a planet "wobbling" its host star. This method has seen vast improvements in recent years, but as instruments near the precision levels needed to detect the small shifts caused by an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star, the detection of these planets is still limited by stellar activity masquerading as planetary signals in RV measurements.

In my work at the Space Telescope Science Institute, we sought to use machine learning to predict stellar activity signals from spectral features and distinguish between stellar activity and real planetary signals. We analyzed both solar and stellar spectra from the high-precision spectropgrahs HARPS-N and NEID for activity-correlated/sensitive features to identify informative inputs and calibrate our predictions for the models. During the course of this research, we determined that further research on the relationships between stellar activity and spectral features is necessary to avoid relying on "black box" models. To this end, we investigated a set of NEID spectra of Ïµ Eridani, a young, active K-dwarf star, to probe these relationships. We created an automated method to correlate line features in the spectra with stellar activity and identified lines sensitive to stellar activity in one or more of these line morphologies at the period of the star's rotation. These lines, which include four newly-identified lines sensitive to stellar activity, can be used as reference points for future work on mitigating stellar activity signals in RV measurements and understanding the physics of stellar activity-sensitive changes in spectral features.

## Outreach and Community Involvement

I (enjoy sharing my research through) teaching and outreach and participate in a number of outreach activities. I hope 

**Planet Finder Academy:** The Planet Finder Academy is an outreach program hosted by the California Institute of Technology for Pasadena-area high school students to learn about exoplanets and exoplanet science. Over the course of a one-week summer session and additional follow-up sessions during the school year, PFA students learn about the history of exoplanet science, the skills and methods that researchers use to study exoplanets today, and how to become involved with exoplanet research themselves.

**EPRV Research Coordination Network:** We will host the ACM Multimedia Asia 2020 conference in Singapore!
